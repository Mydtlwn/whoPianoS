After several days' discussion on github, I found that some strains may have a small mutation, a small number of mutations that may have a big impact or a small impact, and the tracking system is sometimes named for better tracking. This mutation may have a small impact, so that it doesn't cause any waves. I think some systems should be added to the naming system. Inspired by the piano chord thought before, I think this way can be adopted, such as adding sus, add, etc. to indicate that there are only one or three strains with a small number of mutations, such as the form of Ba.5.2.1(add.).# whoPianoS
